# Platformer101

This demo recreates most of the steps from [this unity platformer demo](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation/creating-basic-platformer-game)

The reset and falling platform parts of the video were not implemented in this demo

`master` is set up with the assets needed to start the demo, self descrptive branches have incremental additions.
